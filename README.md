This is a expermintal rogue-like game.
We're trying to offer a better experience for the normal player, instead of
just a game for geekers.

If you need any help (on code), you could find some documents in docs folder.

We haven't release any binary file yet, so you should compile these source
codes by youself. Fortunately we have created some cmake files for it, so you
can easily make your own binary file by following commands (on Linux):
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
Make sure you have installed cmake and make tools. You should get
  Unnaming.out
if everything goes well.

Open an issue if you found any bug.
