class UniformIntRandom;
  It is a interface class which is used to generate random numbers.
  You should define these functions by yourself.

  virtual const int32_t rand(const int32_t& from, const int32_t& to) = 0;
    It should return a number which is not less than ${from} and no greater than ${to}.
  
  virtual void set_seed(const int32_t& seed) = 0;
    Set the seed of random number, which is very important
