# Map.h & Map.cc

Most of functions are very short, so I put them in header.

---

```cpp
const Point Map::PickARandomPointInGroundOrPath(UniformIntRandom& ran) const;
```

> This function will return a totally valid random `Point` in map. Valid means
  that it's `Ground` or `Path`.

---

```cpp
struct Point;
```

> It contaions two intergents, one means `x` and another means `y`. We use it to
  represent a point on a plane.

---

```cpp
strcut Rect;
```

> Almost same as `Point`, but two intergents means `width` and `height`.

---

```cpp
struct RectWithPos;
```

> Combination of `Point` and `Rect`, save a rect and its position.

---

```cpp
inline bool operator<(const Point & a, const Point & b);
```

> Comparation between two `Point`, totally meaningless in physics. However we
  need it for better search.

---

```cpp
class Map;
```

> Most important part in this file! It describe a gaming map for role to
  explore.

    `h`.
