# main.cc

It contains the `main` function of the program. I can't keep it clean yet
because having to add lots of things there to test them.

```cpp
class DefaultUIRandom : public UniformIntRandom;
```

> An class inherit from `UniformIntRandom` interface.
>
> > You can find more informations about interface in `Interface\`.
>
> Use `STL` libs to implement functions.

```cpp
class CommandFor* : public Input::Command;
```

> Classes inherit from `Command` interface.
>
> > You can find more informations about interface in `Interface/`.

> They defined what will happened after you hit a key on your keyboard.

```cpp
void Init(LivingThing* role); 
```

> > You can find more informations about `LivingThing` class in `Object/`.

> Initiate almost every necessery data in this game.

```cpp
int main();
```

> The main loop of this game. 
  First, prepare some important things such as `Map` or `World`.
>
> > You can find more informations about them in `Map/`.
>
> Then, define what every keys means. I use some classes inherit from `Command`
  class so they can be call through a interface.
>
> > You can find more informations about `Command` class in `Input/`.
>
> Finally, we handle inputs in a `while`. Notice that we only re-disaply
  things after something changed.
