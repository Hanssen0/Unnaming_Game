It contains the main function of the program. I can't keep it clean yet because having to add lots of things there to test them.

class DefaultUIRandom : public UniformIntRandom;
  An class inherit from uniform random number interface.
  // You can find more informations about interface in Interface/.
  Use STL libs to implement functions.

class CommandFor* : public Input::Command;
  Classes inherit from command interface.
  // You can find more informations about interface in Interface/.
  They defined what will happened after you hit a key on your keyboard.
  

void Init(LivingThing* role); 
  // You can find more informations about LivingThing class in Object/.
  Initiate almost every necessery data in this game.
    1. Setup some attributes about roles
    2. Setup some attributes about renderer

int main();
  The main loop of this game. 
  First, prepare some important things such as map or world.
  // You can find more informations about them in Map/.
  Then, define what every keys means. I use some classes inherit from Command class so they can be call through a interface.
  // You can find more informations about Command class in Input/.
  Finally, we handle inputs in a "while". Notice that we only re-disaply things after something changed.
